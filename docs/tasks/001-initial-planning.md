# Initial Project Planning

## Ticket: SW-001 Define Core Project Components and Requirements

### Objective

Establish foundational understanding of project scope, core components, and initial architecture decisions.

### Tasks

#### Project Taxonomy

- [ ] Define and describe each core component:
  - [ ] Principles - scope and boundaries
  - [ ] Patterns - scope and boundaries
  - [ ] Elements - scope and boundaries
  - [ ] Templates - scope and boundaries

#### Pattern Storage

- [ ] Define basic structure for storing patterns
- [ ] Create sample pattern in chosen format
- [ ] Document pattern attributes and metadata

#### Initial Focus

- [ ] Select first framework/language to support
- [ ] Identify 2-3 key patterns to implement
- [ ] Create validation criteria for patterns

### Acceptance Criteria

- Core components are clearly defined with examples
- Basic pattern structure is documented
- Initial scope is established and documented
- First implementation target is selected

### Out of Scope for This Ticket

- Implementing parsers
- Building tooling
- Creating extensive pattern library
- Defining all possible use cases

### Next Steps

Will be determined based on outcomes of this ticket, but likely focus on implementing first pattern set.
